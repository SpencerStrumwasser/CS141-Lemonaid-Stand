# CS141-Lemonaid-Stand

lemonadestand.py is the actual game, it contains visuals as well as saving the data in a text file on how the player did.  Each run is randomly sampled and will change, but the general game play is the same.
Directions:
Goal: Earn as much money as possible
  You start with 10 lemons and you can choose how much to sell them for based on the weather conditions
    (if you dont pick a valid number, it will default to 10)
  You then answer questions and receive lemons if you got the questions correct
  The cycle then repeats, until the game ends and tells you how much total money you earned

You need to have pygame working, and be on python 2.7

lemonadetext.py is the text based version of the game, it works for the most part with 2 questions being used for proof of concept
