# CS141-Lemonaid-Stand

lemonadestand.py is the actual game, it is adds some visuals in order to make the game more fun (this is what our project is)

You need to have pygame working, and be on python 2.7

lemonadetext.py is the text based version of the game, it works for the most part with 2 questions being used for proof of concept
